1. `push_back()` vs `emplace_back()`
    - copy vs move
    - vec.insert({a, b}) vs vec.emplace(a, b)

2. `const` vs `constexpr`
    - `const` : could be compile-time or runtime constants
    - `constexpr` : enforces compile-time constants
    - Any variable that should not be modifiable after initialization and whose initializer is known at compile-time should be declared as `constexpr`.
    - Any variable that should not be modifiable after initialization and whose initializer is not known at compile-time should be declared as `const`.

    - Don’t use `const` when passing by value.
    - Don’t use `const` when returning by value.
