Notes for C++

1. `push_back()` vs `emplace_back()`
    - copy vs move
    - vec.insert({a, b}) vs vec.emplace(a, b)

2. `const` vs `constexpr`
    - `const` : could be compile-time or runtime constants
    - `constexpr` : enforces compile-time constants. Fxns might still be runtime, check next point.
    - Any variable that should not be modifiable after initialization and whose initializer is known at compile-time should be declared as `constexpr`.
    - Any variable that should not be modifiable after initialization and whose initializer is not known at compile-time should be declared as `const`.
    - [https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/compile-time-constants-constant-expressions-and-constexpr/](learncpp.com)
    - Don’t use `const` when passing by value.
    - Don’t use `const` when returning by value.

2. `constexpr` and `consteval`. [Link](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/constexpr-and-consteval-functions/)
    - `constexpr`
        - can be called by both compile-time and runtime functions.
        - to ensure compile-time, capture the return value in a new constexpr variable.
    - `consteval` : **-- C++20 --**
        - cannot be called during runtime
        - enforces compile-time call. Parameters should be constexpr.

3. Lambda

4. Variable initialisation. 
    - 3 ways: 
        - **Copy** (`=`)    : Copy values.
        - **Direct** (`()`) : Direct initializer.
        - **Brace** (`{}`)  : Direct list initializer. `<--- use this`
    - Default value for uninitialised variable:

    ```c++
    int a;    // bad: undetermined. could be anything.
    int b();  // bad: interpreted as a function. Will return true!
    int c{};  // good: init to 0
    int d{4.5}; // [error][but safer]. {} doesn't allow value which d can't hold. Doesn't drop '.5' automatically like other 2 methods
    string s; // empty string of size 0 i.e. s = ""
    ```

5. Postfix operator has higher precedence than prefix operator. 
    ```c++ 
    *ptr++ // increment ptr but deref the un-incremented address
    ```

6. Operators which are mainly used for their 'side effects' return their **left operand**. This allows chaining.
    ```c++
    x = y = 5; // evaluates as x = (y = 5)
    cout << "Hello " << "world"; // evaluates as (std::cout << "Hello ") << "world!"
    ```

7. Macros are bad:
    - Can't be treated as normal variables. So, hard time to debug with debuggers; would see the name & not the actual value. Debuggers 'watch' these variables.
    - Don't follow normal scoping rules; might end up getting used somewhere in the code!
    - Risk of a variable being defined as a macro in some file.
