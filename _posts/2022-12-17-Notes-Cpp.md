Notes for C++

1. `push_back()` vs `emplace_back()`
    - copy vs move
    - vec.insert({a, b}) vs vec.emplace(a, b)

2. `const` vs `constexpr`
    - `const` : could be compile-time or runtime constants
    - `constexpr` : enforces compile-time constants. Fxns might still be runtime, check next point.
    - Any variable that should not be modifiable after initialization and whose initializer is known at compile-time should be declared as `constexpr`.
    - Any variable that should not be modifiable after initialization and whose initializer is not known at compile-time should be declared as `const`.
    - [https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/compile-time-constants-constant-expressions-and-constexpr/](learncpp.com)
    - Don’t use `const` when passing by value.
    - Don’t use `const` when returning by value.

2. `constexpr` and `consteval`. [Link](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/constexpr-and-consteval-functions/)
    - `constexpr`
        - can be called by both compile-time and runtime functions.
        - to ensure compile-time, capture the return value in a new constexpr variable.
    - `consteval` : **-- C++20 --**
        - cannot be called during runtime
        - enforces compile-time call. Parameters should be constexpr.

3. Lambda
    - 

4. Variable initialisation. 
    - 3 ways: 
        - **Copy** (`=`)    : Copy values.
        - **Direct** (`()`) : Direct initializer.
        - **Brace** (`{}`)  : Direct list initializer. `<--- use this`
    - Default value for uninitialised variable:

    ```c++
    int a;    // bad: undetermined. could be anything.
    int b();  // bad: interpreted as a function. Will return true!
    int c{};  // good: init to 0
    int d{4.5}; // [error][but safer]. {} doesn't allow value which d can't hold. Doesn't drop '.5' automatically like other 2 methods
    string s; // empty string of size 0 i.e. s = ""
    ```

5. Postfix operator has higher precedence than prefix operator. 
    ```c++ 
    *ptr++ // increment ptr but deref the un-incremented address
    ```

6. Operators which are mainly used for their 'side effects' return their **left operand**. This allows chaining.
    ```c++
    x = y = 5; // evaluates as x = (y = 5)
    cout << "Hello " << "world"; // evaluates as (std::cout << "Hello ") << "world!"
    ```

7. Macros are bad:
    - Can't be treated as normal variables. So, hard time to debug with debuggers; would see the name & not the actual value. Debuggers 'watch' these variables.
    - Don't follow normal scoping rules; might end up getting used somewhere in the code!
    - Risk of a variable being defined as a macro in some file.

8. Vector `reserve()` vs `resize()` vs nothing!:
    - `reserve` would allocate memory ahead of time. **Capacity** will be affected, not size.
    - `resize` would insert or delete elements. **Size** is affected. Capacity may not be if new size <= old capacity.
    - nothing would grow/double the vector when size>capacity. Required O(N) copying everytime!!

9. `lvalue` vs `rvalue`:
    - `lvalues` : variables/objects that persist beyond the end of the expression.
    - `rvalues` : literals or returned value of functions/operators that are discarded at the end of expression.

10. pointers(*) vs reference(&): [Great answer link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57483/what-are-the-differences-between-a-pointer-variable-and-a-reference-variable?page=1&tab=scoredesc#tab-top)
    - pointer: First account forwarding to second account. The pointer itself has a memory location.
        - name1@email.com -> name_surname@email.com
    - reference: **Alias** of email. Both are same account; no separate memory.
        - netID@uni.com, first.last@uni.com
        - has to be initialised. can't be reseated. 

11. L-value reference with `const`:
    ```c++
    int x { 50 };
    const int y {100};

    int& ref { x };           // valid: lvalue reference bound to a modifiable lvalue
    const int& const_ref {x}; // still valid

    // const_ref = 51 // invalid: can't change through const reference.
    x = 51;           // valid: can be changed through non-const identifier 
    cout << << ref << " " << const_ref << endl; // 51 51

    int& ref_y { y };           // invalid: can't bind to a non-modifiable lvalue
    const int& ref_y_const {y}; // valid

    int& ref_rvalue {1};        // invalid: can't bind to an r-value. Else you'll try to modify 1 using the reference
    const int& ref_rvalue2 {1}; // valid: temporary object of rvalue is created.
    ```

11. `const` ptr : [compiler-explorer link](https://compiler-explorer.com/z/o716TG8oo)
    ```c++
        const MyClass* ptr = &obj;
        MyClass* const ptr = &obj;
        const MyClass* const ptr = &obj; //read-only
    ```

12. `unique_ptr` and `shared_ptr`:
    - unique_ptr
    - shared_ptr : multiple smart pointers share the same resource. Resource is deallocated when the last smart ptr goes out of scope (count==0)
        - uses reference counting for control block.
        - prefer make_shared. Combines resource + control into a sigle memory.

13. Caution:
    ```c++
    int decimal = 10;
    int binary = 0b1010;
    int hex = 0x1010;
    int octal = 010; // <-- prefix zero means Octal!!
    ```

14. Python-like bindings:
    ```c++
    for(auto [key, val]: my_map){
        cout << key << ": " << val << '\n';
    }
    ```

15. Classes:
    - [Compiler Explorer code link](https://compiler-explorer.com/z/oh434PqG9)
    - Default access to members and methods is private
    - classes with virtual functions maintain *vtbl (virtual function table)* to determine the function call
    - 

16. Dynamic & Static cast:
    ```c++
        if(TypeA* p = dynamic_cast<TypeA*>(ptr)){
            cout << "ptr is of TypeA" << endl;
        }

        int a = static_cast<int>(3.4);
    ```
