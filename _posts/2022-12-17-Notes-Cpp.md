Notes for C++

1. `push_back()` vs `emplace_back()`
    - copy vs move
    - vec.insert({a, b}) vs vec.emplace(a, b)

2. `const` vs `constexpr`
    - `const` : could be compile-time or runtime constants
    - `constexpr` : enforces compile-time constants
    - Any variable that should not be modifiable after initialization and whose initializer is known at compile-time should be declared as `constexpr`.
    - Any variable that should not be modifiable after initialization and whose initializer is not known at compile-time should be declared as `const`.
    - [https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/compile-time-constants-constant-expressions-and-constexpr/](learncpp.com)
    - Don’t use `const` when passing by value.
    - Don’t use `const` when returning by value.

3. Lambda

4. Variable initialisation. 
    - 3 ways: 
        - **Copy** (`=`)    : Copy values.
        - **Direct** (`()`) : Direct initializer.
        - **Brace** (`{}`)  : Direct list initializer. `<--- use this`
    - Default value for uninitialised variable:

    ```c++
    int a;    // bad: undetermined. could be anything.
    int b();  // bad: interpreted as a function. Will return true!
    int c{};  // good: init to 0
    int d{4.5}; // [error][but safer]. {} doesn't allow value which d can't hold. Doesn't drop '.5' automatically like other 2 methods
    string s; // empty string of size 0 i.e. s = ""
    ```

5. Postfix operator has higher precedence than prefix operator. 
    ```c++ 
    *ptr++ // increment ptr but deref the un-incremented address
    ```

6. Operators which are mainly used for their 'side effects' return their **left operand**. This allows chaining.
    ```c++
    x = y = 5; // evaluates as x = (y = 5)
    cout << "Hello " << "world"; // evaluates as (std::cout << "Hello ") << "world!"
    ```
