My broad interests:
- ML model Inference and Performance Optimisation
- Computer Vision; Camera; Imaging

I'm currently studying Advanced Computer Vision courses at the Princeton University under [Prof. Jia Deng](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jiadeng/) and [Prof. Olga Russakovsky](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~olgarus/). I'm enrolled as a Masters in Computer Science at the Rutgers University [Graduating in May 2023].

I carry **3 years of work experience** shipping AI based sofware solutions. I recently interned at Nvidia where I worked on the [Inference pipeline of a Speech model](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/divakar-verma_serving-rnn-t-speech-to-text-model-on-triton-activity-6972944540781395968-PDbx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). Previously, I worked with Samsung R&D Institute and Flipart Inc. to ship Camera-Imaging and Speech solutions respectively.
