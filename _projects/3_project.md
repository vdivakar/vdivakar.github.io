Text-to-Speech model for Hindi language (Flipkart):- 
The aim of this project was to generate audio speech in Hindi language for the given text sentences.  I started on this project while I was working with Flipkart.
â€‹
Key learnings:
 - Unsupervised generative models
 - Autoregressive models
 - Flow (& inverse Flow) based models
 - Papers I've read - [Link](https://github.com/vdivakar/Papers-Stack#papers-stack)

 C++ decoder for Speech recognition engine (Flipkart):- 
Worked on the decoder module of the ASR pipeline (Automated Speech Recognition). 
Key responsibilities:
 - Implemented new features into production with C++ code base.
 - Improved latency & memory consumption.
