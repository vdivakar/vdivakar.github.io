Demosaicing using CNNs (Samsung)
A camera sensor captures single channel image where each pixel contains only 1 color information. The process of interpolating the remaining 2 colors via neighboring pixels to construct a full colored image is called Demosaicing. We used a deep learning model to approach this problem.
Key learning:
 - Used a ResNet-Bottleneck based deep learning architecture.
 - Wrote the architecture from scratch in Tensorflow 1.x to conduct multiple experiments
 - Residual learning; skip connections
