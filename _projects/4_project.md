MNIST-Muddle (Personal project)

The aim of this project was to get a practical exposure of how Latent Domain works in deep learning. This is a simple project which tries to generate poorly written hand-digits by interpolating between the nearest cluster.
â€‹
Got practical exposure to:
 - Auto Encoders
 - Latent domain
 - PyTorch hosting using Streamlit
 - Project Demo - [Link](https://share.streamlit.io/vdivakar/mnistmuddle/br_streamlit/app.py)
 - GitHub [Link]()
 - Blog post **LINK**
