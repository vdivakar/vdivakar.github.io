Single Image HDR reconstruction & enhancement(Samsung)
Camera sensors typically have low dynamic range which often leads to over-exposure or under-exposure of regions in outdoor scenes. This project aimed at enhancing the overall image by improving such regions.
Key learnings:
 - Un-paired images DL training
 - Cyclic loss, encoder-decoder
 - HDR, tone mapping, linear vs non-linear images, histogram
 - What is HDR ? [(Notes Link)](/assets/pdf/HDR_ppt.pdf)
